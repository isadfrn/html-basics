        <h2>LINUX's History</h2>

          This is just a sentimental journey into some of the first posts concerning linux, so you
          can happily press 'n' now if you actually thought you'd get anything technical:
          <q cite="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html"
            >Hello everybody out there using minix - I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a
            hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been
            brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things
            people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of
            the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).</q
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          PS. To make things really clear - yes I can run gcc on it, and bash, and most of the gnu
          [bin/file]utilities, but it's not very debugged, and the library is really minimal. It
          doesn't even support floppy-disks yet. It won't be ready for distribution for a couple of
          months. Even then it probably won't be able to do much more than minix, and much less in
          some respects. It will be free though (probably under gnu-license or similar).
        </p>

          Well, obviously something worked on my machine: I doubt I had yet gotten gcc to compile
          itself under linux (or I would have been too proud of it not to mention it). Still before
          any release-date.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, October 5th, I seem to have released 0.02. As I already mentioned, 0.01 didn't
          actually come with any binaries: it was just source code for people interested in what
          linux looked like. Note the lack of announcement for 0.01: I wasn't too proud of it, so I
          think I only sent a note to everybody who had shown interest.

            historically the main developer of the Linux kernel, used by Linux distributions and
